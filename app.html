                        Pando is an app that is focused on encouraging users to adopt a healthy and sustainable lifestyle. We achieve this by providing a platform for users to actively participate in eco-friendly activities in a gamified way, in hopes of encouraging them to live a more sustainable and eco-friendly lifestyle. Pando plans to start at a local scale, by partnering with green businesses all around Groningen in order to incentivize the citizens to reduce their carbon footprint in a way that is beneficial to all parties.

                            Pando’s main objective is to create a sustainable community in the city of Groningen. In order for our goal to succeed, we will need the help of local businesses who are already actively exercising their corporate social responsibility to the environment. With these partners, Pando can establish touchpoints for our users all around the city in order to influence an environmentally friendly and sustainable lifestyle for people. With every purchase by a Pando user at one of these touchpoints, Pando will plant a tree - both in real life and in your virtual Pando rainforest.

                            Our app includes a virtual rainforest that the user can grow and expand as they continue to use our app. With every purchase made with Pando at a partnered location that exceeds €15, a new tree is added to the user’s rainforest and Earth Points are added to their account. With more trees in their rainforest, the biodiversity also increases. Users can then customize their rainforest with these Earth Points by spending them on unique trees. The virtual rainforest can then be shared on social media.

                                The way Pando manages to plant one tree for every purchase over €15 at a partnered touchpoint is through a service provided by an organization called One Tree Planted. The organization is a non-profit focused on global reforestation. They promise to plant 1 tree for $1, and offer a very convenient model for businesses to act on their initiative as well.

                            The payment at Pando touchpoints is handled by the partnered business. However, with every purchase, Pando users will receive a one time use, QR code that they can then scan with their Pando app to receive their Earth Points and have their tree planted in real life, as well as added to their virtual rainforest. We encourage our partners to provide the QR codes on a digital medium to save paper on receipts.

                            <br>Earth Points are a virtual currency that our app uses to reward users for their environmentally friendly lifestyle. Users can earn Earth Points by shopping at our partnered locations and by performing activities that are beneficial to the environment, such as biking and taking part in group clean up activities. Users can then choose to exchange these Earth Points for in-app vouchers that they can then use to redeem free products at our mentioned partnered locations, or invest in their virtual rainforest.
